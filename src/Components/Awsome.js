           <p className="Awosomepara">Soothing beauty, offbeat tourists attractions, spiritual ambiance, the sacred river, humble people, and zealous culture, Assam boasts plenty of fascinating secrets.
                          Being one of the Northeast Indiaâ€™s iconic seven sisters, a holiday in Assam is about witnessing a heady mix of history, culture, and nature at the same time.
                          The state happens to be the land of many wildlife reserves, which are further home to the one-horned rhino, one of Assam's tourism best-known mascots.</p>
